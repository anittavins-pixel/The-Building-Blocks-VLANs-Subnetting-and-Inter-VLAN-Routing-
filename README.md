 Network+ Topics: OSI Model (Layers 2 & 3), Subnetting, 802.1Q Trunking, VLANs, and Default Gateways. The Scenario: You are setting up a network for a small law firm. They need two separate networks: STAFF and GUESTS. Guests should not be able to access Staff files, but both need to talk to the Router. Tasks:  Subnetting: Take the network 192.168.10.0/24 and divide it into two equal subnets. (Assign the first half to VLAN 10 and the second half to VLAN 20). VLAN Creation: On a 2960 Switch, create VLAN 10 (STAFF) and VLAN 20 (GUESTS). Access Ports: Assign ports Fa0/1-10 to VLAN 10 and Fa0/11-20 to VLAN 20. Trunking: Configure the link between the Switch and a Router (ISR4321) as an 802.1Q Trunk. Router-on-a-Stick: Create sub-interfaces on the router (e.g., Gig0/0/0.10 and Gig0/0/0.20) to act as the default gateways for each VLAN. Submission: Finalized Packet Trace file.     Validation:  Can a PC in STAFF ping its default gateway? Use show vlan brief and show interfaces trunk to verify the database
